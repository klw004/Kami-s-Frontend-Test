Hi there, and thanks for applying to join the FLE intern team!
To give you a chance to demonstrate how you approach a problem,
using a variety of technologies and a healthy dose of creative
freedom, we've put together this short practice project. To make
it a bit faster for you to get started, we put together this
skeleton repository that you can use as a starting point.

Within this repository are some static assets necessary to display a simple HTML page. Here are your tasks:

1. Beautify the scrolling list on the left. Bootstrap is already loaded for you, but feel free to add other resources as you need. (please do not delete any existing resources)
2. Make the scrolling list resize as the windows resized.
3. Create a handle/tab attached to the scrolling list, that when clicked, displays or hides the list accordingly.
4. Replace the default scrolling bar of the list with slimScroll (already included in this repository).
5. Profile the overall loading speed of the page using Google Chrome's DevTools. Give us your analysis of the results.
6. Optimize the critical rendering path and loading speed using the results you obtained.

So to get things started, do the following:

1. Clone this repo into your local machine (DO NOT FORK!)
2. Create a new repository in your github account
3. Change your local repository's origin remote to point to your new remote Github repository
4. Once you're satisfied with your code, push your local repository into the remote Github repository
5. Send us the link to your Github repo!

That's it! We'll review your code soon and get back to you once we're done!
